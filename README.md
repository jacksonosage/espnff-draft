# espnff-draft

This repository contains some scripts I wrote to scrape draft data from ESPN Fantasy Football Leagues.

In most of the scripts I interact with a local PostgreSQL database which is not hosted anywhere online. However, if you are interested in exploring the data I scraped I included .csv files of all the tables in my database. Additionally, I included the table definitions of my postgres database in the file 'table_definitions_2017.sql' if you are interested in setting up your own local database with the same schema.
