# espnff-draft

This repository contains some scripts I wrote to scrape draft data from ESPN Fantasy Football Leagues.

In most of the scripts I interact with a local PostgreSQL database which I do not have hosted online. However, if you are interested in exploring the data I scraped I included .csv files of all the tables in my database.
